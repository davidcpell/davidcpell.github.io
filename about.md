Welcome! My name is David. I'm a husband, father, and software engineer working in Durham, NC. In my spare time (_ha ha_) I enjoy learning foreign languages, reading classical literature, and playing video games. My hope is that I'll be able to share programming tidbits in language that is understabable to people who aren't this guy:

Put another way: this blog is directed towards novices. Partially this is because I still consider myself a novice, but I also have a real interest in writing at a level that is accessible to people who didn't study Computer Science but have recently begun to delve into Ruby programming, whether as a hobby or as part of a career change. I know from experience that many of the resources out there use technical terminology (jargon) and assume background knowledge in a way that can be frustrating to someone who is just getting started. Thanks for stopping by and please follow me on Twitter at @davidcpell if you'd like to be notified when I've published a new post!
