Welcome to Dirty Code! My name is David. I'm a husband, father, and software engineer in central North Carolina. My hope is that I'll be able to share programming tidbits in language that is understabable to people who aren't this guy:

I started my first software job in the summer of 2014 and have learned a lot since then. However, I still have a _long_ way to go, and thought that by documenting my journey I might be able to help other people who are just dabbling or might like to make a career change like I did. 

If you didn't study Computer Science in college and are just trying your hand at programming, trying to wade through all of the technical terminology (jargon) in "help articles" written by people who have been doing this for years can be frustrating. It's not their fault! As we get better at something we often forget what it's like to be a novice. 

I'll let you decide whether my small contribution is any improvement over other resources you're using! If you're scratching your head at the end of any of my posts, I've failed and want to hear from you about what wasn't clear.
